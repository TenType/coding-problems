# Prime Numbers
Find all prime numbers up to a given limit!

Given an integer `n`, return an array of [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) that are less than `n`.

## Example
### Input
```py
n = 15
```

### Output
```py
[2, 3, 5, 7, 13]
```

### Explanation
`2`, `3`, `5`, `7`, and `13` are the only positive prime numbers that are less than `15`.

## Prototype
```py
def solution(n: int) -> list[int]:
    ...
```

## Constraints
- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
